## Project Name
Django Polls App

## Description
The Django Polls App is a simple, yet powerful polling application built using Django. Users can create polls, vote on different choices, and view results in real-time. The app serves as an excellent example of Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern, and it can be used as a starting point for more complex applications.
